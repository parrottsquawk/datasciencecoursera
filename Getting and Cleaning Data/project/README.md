Getting and Cleaning Data

* The script run_analysis.R runs the summarization code on the wearable dataset.
* The script describe_data.R provides a function to take raw feature names from the data set and convert them to a more readable version which is based on the documentation which came with the data set.
* A full description of the data is in the CodeBook.md file. Here is where you can see descriptions of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
